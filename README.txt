Provides custom post types to support academic content types.

== Description ==

Academic websites require certain types of information such as publications and undergrad lists which are not natively supported by Wordpress.
WP Scholar seeks to fit this role by creating a few basic, necessary CPTs that can be used to build an academic website.
Additionally, WP Scholar provides basic fallback template files that support Zurb Foundation responsive layouts.
All fallback templates can be overriden in the site theme in exactly the same manner as child themes. Simply replace
the single-{cpt}.php or archive-{cpt}.php files and code as desired.

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets 
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png` 
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
